# Year of Open Science Conference Participation (Preview)

With NASA declaring 2023 as the Year of Open Science, the TOPS team will be participating in conferences across the nation (and internationally) to encourage the wider scientific community to join us in promoting, strengthening, and engaging with open science.

Activities for collaborating on open science conferences with TOPS can be tailored to your organizational and audience needs. Our engagement opportunities can range from simple open science themed collateral to NASA TOPS Booths and Workshops and everywhere in between.
